# Prime number visualizer

A prime is a natural number that cannot be formed by multipling two smaller **natural** numbers. The aim of this project was to have a visualization of it by using their **Polar Coordonate**.

* **Scaling** is a slider use to scale the visualization
* **Sort range** is a slider use to set the maximum range for the sorting. 

__Careful the maximum value is 1 million but I advice to not go over 200 000, it will take time some seconds to see the result at max scale. Down there you will find the 1 million visualization.__
